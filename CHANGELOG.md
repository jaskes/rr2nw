# RR2NW changelog

This changelog records accepted work in the modern continuation. It does not
claim authorship of inherited Logos code or retail data.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added the Windows-first 1.0 roadmap with a modernization-first execution
  order: automated evidence first, modern CMake/x86 vertical slice second, and
  the legacy Watcom build as a non-blocking reference lane.
- Added reference-build, retail-parity, architecture, data-provenance,
  behavior-decision and release-process contracts.
- Recorded the verified May 1999 retail baseline, source/retail file-diff
  counts, local installation classification and known artifact hashes.
- Recorded the high-confidence DEP/PE correlation for repeated retail
  `0xc0000005` crashes and prohibited global DEP disabling as a product fix.
- Added standard-library Python and PowerShell M0 tooling for deterministic
  manifests, normalized-text diffs, PE/import/RVA inspection, stable parity
  IDs, private Windows-state capture and bounded launch observations.
- Added a verified read-only May 1999 retail fixture and a redacted public M0
  baseline bound to the complete private evidence by SHA-256.
- Protected the recovered `nw/` tree from automatic text/line-ending
  normalization while standardizing new project files on UTF-8/LF.

### Changed

- Defined Windows 10/11 as the only mandatory platforms for 1.0.
- Allowed a modern x86 executable on x64 Windows for 1.0; native x64 is no
  longer a release blocker.
- Deferred Linux, macOS and multiplayer until after Windows 1.0.
- Moved manual testing out of the initial preservation/build milestones and
  into late platform smoke and the exact packaged release-candidate gate.
- Adopted permanent `develop` integration and `master` release branches with
  direct explicit release merges and annotated SemVer tags, without a required
  pull-request workflow.
